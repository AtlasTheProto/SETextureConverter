# SETextureConverter
Tool for converting Space Engineers' DDS files to TIF for use with Enenra's Space Engineers Utilities addon for Blender 2.8x

https://github.com/enenra/space-engineers-utilities

### General Usage

Tool Path and Game directory are auto populated with directories relative to the C drive, but if you have them installed elsewhere, please change the path.

"SEUT Tools Folder" is genenrally the Tools folder in your SEUT folder. You were told to put texconv.exe there in the SEUT walkthrough

"SEUT Textures Folder" is the Textures folder in your SEUT folder. This is where everything goes.

"Space Engineers Textures Folder" is the games own textures folder. Typically in SpaceEngineers/Content/Textures

***PLEASE ENSURE THAT THE LAST ONE IS CORRECT OR THE MATLIBS WILL NOT LINK CORRECTLY***

*You can reset everything to default by clicking file- reset settings*

### Presets

A presets.ini file is included with this release, this contains all the necessary paths the tool needs to convert all the textures Enenra's matlib files need.

# To load the preset, click File > Load Presets - this is highly reccomended for maximum compatibility with MatLibs

### Issues

Please report all issues to this github.

Literally none of this would exist if it wasnt for my good friend Xayr, go check him out.
