# SETextureConverter
Tool for converting Space Engineers' DDS files to TIF for use with Enenra's Space Engineers Utilities addon for Blender 2.8x

https://github.com/enenra/space-engineers-utilities

### General Usage

Tool Path and Game directory are auto populated with directories relative to the C drive, but if you have them installed elsewhere, please change the path.

"Game Directory" is the root folder of your space engineers install (common/SpaceEngineers)

"Tool Path" is the folder in the modsdk containing the "texconv.exe" executable

"Output Directory" is, in most cases, the "Textures" folder in your SEUT folder. As this is what Enenra's matlibs need to function, so please set it to be that.

### Presets

By default, the zip file in the releases tab comes with a presets.ini file, this contains all the necessary paths the tool needs to convert all the textures Enenra's matlib files need.

To load the preset, click File > Load Presets

### Issues

Please report all issues to this github.
